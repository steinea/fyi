* Home Assistant on a [Home Assistant Yellow](https://ameridroid.com/products/home-assistant-yellow)
* Nothing on my [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-4-starter-kit.html) at the moment
* Papers at [steinea.work](https://steinea.work/) and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/search?q=metadata.creators.person_or_org.name%253A%22Stein%252C%20Eric%22)
* Posts are currently [PESOS](https://indieweb.org/PESOS) from [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/steinea.bsky.social) to [steinea.work](https://steinea.work/posting/) (where I also keep the archive of my Twitter posts), but long term I want a proper [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) setup for posting, with a self-hosted [ATProtocol](https://atproto.com/) and/or [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/) service
* Repositories with [GitHub](https://github.com/), looking at migration to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/)
* Websites with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and [Hover](https://www.hover.com/)
* [Webmentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) are to do

*To do: more tinkering, more [self-hosting](https://kittsteiner.blog/self-hosting/).*
