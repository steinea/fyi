"We set out upon our pursuit of being,
and it seemed to us that the series of our
questions had led us to the heart of being.
But behold, at the moment when we thought
we were arriving at the goal, a glance cast
on the question itself has revealed to us
suddenly that we are encompassed with
nothingness. The permanent possibility
of non-being, outside us and within,
conditions our questions about being."

—Sartre, Being and Nothingness, p. 5


"Shall we utter some words about nothingness?
What is there to say? How to begin? How
can anything be said about nothing without
violating its very nature, perhaps even its
conditions of possibility? Isn't any utterance
about nothingness always already a performative
breach of that which one means to address?
Have we not already said too much simply in
pronouncing its name? Perhaps we should let
the emptiness speak for itself."

—Barad, What Is the Measure of Nothingness?, p. 4
