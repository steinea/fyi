This site is [human made](https://hinokodo.itch.io/human-made). I am a [humanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism) by training, and this and my other websites are exercises in making things as a human, for other humans.

I do not use [LLMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) or other [GAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence) tools, and no content on this site has ever been or ever will be generated with an LLM. Generative AI has significant [psychological](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-ai-chatbots-may-be-fueling-psychotic-episodes/), [social](https://archive.is/MA3Ii), and [climate](https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117) impacts that proponents have failed to substantively address, or even acknowledge, rendering its use and continued promotion an ethical disaster.

My company does research and development work in [ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), and I have ML scientists and engineers on my team. Machine learning technologies are a significant part of modern AAA game development, and while LLMs and GAI are indeed applications of the broader field of ML, ML should be understood as distinct from the present hype and speculation around generative AI.

Previously, I have studied and conducted some research in corpus linguistics and discourse analysis, and in the process relied upon [NLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) technologies and open corpuses of natural language data collected through methods that have since been colonized by generative AI. Academics are still [negotiating](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666799123000266) the relationship between traditional methods and those dependent on generative AI.

On this site, I use the [Content Signal](https://contentsignals.org/) mechanism developed by Cloudflare to disallow AI crawlers. I do not block the CCBot from [Common Crawl](https://commoncrawl.org/), so that my web content can be made available in the public archive and mirrored at the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/).
