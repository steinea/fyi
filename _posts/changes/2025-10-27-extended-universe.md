We're in a new era for the site...

Rather than host everything on one very ungainly static site, I've split my content across four domains: [steinea.ca](https://steinea.ca/) hosts my writing, [steinea.fyi](/) hosts my IndieWeb identity, [steinea.work](https://steinea.work/) hosts my resume, and [steinea.xyz](https://steinea.xyz/) hosts my digital garden.

I've preserved historical changelogs [here](/changes/), which provide a fun look back at all the iterations of my personal site.

Not sure what my ongoing changelog procedure will be. Ideally, I continue to have just the one slash page at [steinea.fyi/changes](/changes/), but not sure if this practice will become confusing if I'm talking about changes across the newly extended universe... We shall see!
