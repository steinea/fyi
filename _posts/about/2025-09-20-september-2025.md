I am a gameplay producer at EA SPORTS, currently working across user-experience research, data analytics, quality management, and organisation design.

My background is in academic game studies and game development education, with experience teaching game design, interactive storytelling, video game aesthetics, and project management.

I have written extensively on the games of FromSoftware, and have conducted a number of other critical-philosophical studies of games including *The Last of Us*, *Starfield*, *Kentucky Route Zero*, *Hollow Knight*, *Dream Askew / Dream Apart*, and *Trophy Dark*.

My ongoing research is informed by the twentieth century continental tradition of philosophy, with special interest in phenomenology, metaphysics, and philosophy of science, and more recent developments in speculative realism and digital humanities.

I maintain an active research-creation practice, with a large body of published work in print and digital ranging from tabletop roleplaying games to lyric games to experimental poetry.

I am located in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia. I work and live on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territories of the Stó꞉lō, Mathxwí, Semá:th, and Kwantlen First Nations.
