My current research program is plural and open, with many concurrent branches of inquiry. Right [now](https://nownownow.com/about), I am thinking about:

* Deleuze and Guattari
* Samuel Beckett
* Ã‰mile Zola
* Irish history and language
* Shakespeare's history plays
* Merleau-Ponty and enaction
* The Last of Us and interpretation
* FromSoftware and archives
